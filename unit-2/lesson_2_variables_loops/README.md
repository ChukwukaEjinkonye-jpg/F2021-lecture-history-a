# Unit 2 - Lesson 2: Variables, Control Flow, and Loops

## Essential Questions
* What is a variable?
    - storage for data 
    - a thing you use to hold a value
* Why might it be helpful to think of a variable as a _binding_?
* What is the difference between variables declared with `let`, `const`, and `var`?
* When would we declare a variable with `let` vs. `const`?
* What does it mean for a variable to be _block scoped_?
* What does control flow mean?
* How do `while` loops, `do...while`, and `for` loops differ? What do they have in common?
* What two keywords can we use to interrupt iteration?

## var vs let vs const 
- var: allows you to re-declare AND re-assign 
- let: DOES NOT allow you to re-declare, but it does let you reassign 
- const : DOES NOT allow you to re-declare, and it DOES NOT allow you to re-assign either
 
- let and const HAVE block scope. var does not

## Declaring
- using `var` or `let` or `const` to create a variable

## Assignment 
- `=` is the assignment operator

## Vocabulary
* constant
* scope
* control flow
* loops and iteration
