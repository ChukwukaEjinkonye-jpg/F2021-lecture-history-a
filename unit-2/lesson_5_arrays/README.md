# Unit 2 - Lesson 5: Arrays

## Essential Question
* What is a _data structure_?
- a way to organize a lot data
- Array (have INDEXES)
- Object (have PROPERTIES)

* What are _arrays_ and why are they useful data structures?
- Arrays have an ORDER
- Arrays are lists

* How do we access individual elements within arrays?
- element (items inside the array)
- index (starts at 0 go up until the length of the array minus 1)

* How do we access and change the length of an array?
- `.length`
- change length by adding new elements
- reassign the legnth property
 
* Of the six JavaScript data types, how do we classify arrays?
- Arrays are a type of Object

* What does it mean for arrays to be _passed by reference_ in JavaScript?

* Under what conditions will an array be strictly or abstractly equal to another array?


* How do we iterate over arrays?
- looping over every element in an array
```js
for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
    console.log(array[i])
}
```

## Vocabulary
* data structure
* array
* index
* pass-by-value
* pass-by-reference
* array method
* rest parameters
* spread operator
* destructuring


## Advanced Array Topics
* What are the key methods for manipulating arrays?
* What does it mean for arrays to be _passed by reference_ in JavaScript?
* What is the purpose of _rest parameters_? How do they differ from the `arguments` object?
* What does it mean to _destructure_ a JavaScript array?
* What is the purpose of the spread operator?
