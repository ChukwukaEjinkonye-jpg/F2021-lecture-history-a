## Review
- What is AJAX?
  - Request (grab) data without refreshing the webpage
  - Request data from some API 
- What is `fetch`?
  - It is built into JS and it allows us to implement AJAX in your JS programs
  - when some events happens => fetch => put it on the DOM

### Key Terms:

- GET request
    - getting data
    - asking the server: Hey, can you get me this data?
- POST request
    - sending data!!!
    - asking the server: Hey, can I give you this data?
    - assume the server will do something with that data
- Request Headers
- Body
- Promises
- Error handling
- try/catch
- Browser
- Inspector
