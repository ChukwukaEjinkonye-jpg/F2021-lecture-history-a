# Unit 4 Lesson 3
## Constructors and Prototypes

## Why Object Oriented Programming?
- Why should we create 'instances?'
- What are the different syntaxes for creating instances?

## The `new` keyword in front of a function invocation
- Create an empty object
- the value of `this` IS that empty object
- return said empthy object

### Factory Functions vs Constructor 
- both used create instances 
- factory are more low-level (explicit)
- constructor more high-level (abstraction)


### Key Terms
* constructor
* prototype object
* prototype property
* prototypal inheritance
* instantiation

### Essential Question
* What are the benefits of using _constructors_ to create objects?
* What is the benefit of storing methods on the prototype of the constructor?
* What is the association between an object's prototype and its constructor?
* What are the ways in which we can examine the link between an object and its constructor?
* What is prototypal inheritance?
