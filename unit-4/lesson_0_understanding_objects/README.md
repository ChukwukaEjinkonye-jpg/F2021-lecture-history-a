# Unit 4 - Lesson 0: Understanding Objects

## Key Terms
* encapsulation
* state - data that the program keeps track of
* behavior - things the program can do (functions/methods)
* data properties
* method (function properties)
* enumerable
* `this` keyword = the object that you're calling the method off
* factory functions
* accessor properties (getters and setters)
* private data
    * not allowed in JS 
    * convention we can use!

## Essential Questions
* What is abstraction? Why do we use it?
    * The process of hiding the complex
    * To make things more simple

array.push()
array.map(x => 2*x)

* What is encapsulation? Why do we use it? How do objects enable it?
    * Bundling of things into a single unit
    * "Hiding" state and behavior inside of an object 

* How do objects encapsulate state (using data properties)? How do they encapsulate behavior (using methods)?

* What are factory functions and why are they useful?
    * create mulit objects that all share the same "shape" (state and behavior) 

* How do we create _private data_ within JavaScript objects? What is the role of _JavaScript Object Accessors_?
