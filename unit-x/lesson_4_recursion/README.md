# Lesson: Recursion

## Essential Questions
* What is recursion?
    * something that is repeated; recursion is a type of looping 
    * call on the same function (problem) over-and-over again
    * some stopping point
    
* What type of problems are best solved using recursion?
    * Solve a problem that is made up some the same, but smaller/simplier problem

* What are the benefits of writing functions recursively? What are the drawbacks?
    * Recursion is sometimes less code or is simplier to write 
    * Recursion tends to take up more memory than an iterative approach because of more calls pushed to the call stack

## Key Terms
* Call stack - a data structure used by JavaScript to keep track of all the function calls in a program
* Stack Trace - The stack gets printed whenever there is an error
* Stack overflow (Yes, it's a website) - type of inifite loop where there are too many function calls and we run out of memory
* Recursion
* Base case
* Recursive case
