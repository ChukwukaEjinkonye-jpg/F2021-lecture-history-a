# Lesson: Trees

## Essential Question
* What are properties of a tree?
* What is the definition of a tree data structure? Define it in two ways: 
    * (1) a description of edges, nodes, and paths, and 
    * (2) as a recursive data structure??
* Where do we encounter tree data structures in computer science?


## 95% Will be Binary Trees
* What is a binary tree and how does it differ from a regular tree?
    * Every node has at most 2 children (has 0 to 2 children)
    * Usually, the values (data) is numeric
    
* What is a binary search tree and how does it differ from a binary tree?
    * Every node has at most 2 children (has 0 to 2 children)
    * All nodes in the left subtree have a lesser value than the root 
    * All nodes in the right subtree have a greater value than the root
