# Lesson: Linked Lists

* Let's talk about arrays
* Array has - Sequential access
* What are the run times for insertion, deletion, and accessing from array?

[1, 2, 3, 4]
// add an element to the end of this array `.push()`; O(1)
// removing an element from the end of this array `.pop()`; O(1)
// add an element to the BEGINING of this array `.unshift()`; O(n)
// removing an element from the BEGINGING of this array `shift()`; O(n)
// accessing from an array is O(1) if you know the index
// searching through an array if you don't know the index O(n)

## Essential Questions
* What is an _abstract data type_?
    * An idea
    * OOP to model this idea 
    

* What are the tradeoffs between linked lists and arrays?
* linked list take up more memory 
* linked lists do not ever shift, saving time when it comes to adding/removing items from the list 

* What are the tradeoffs between singly linked lists and doubly linked lists?
* What are the run times for insertion, deletion, and accessing from linked lists?

## Key Terms
* Abstract data type
* Node
* Singly linked list
* Doubly linked list
* Random access
